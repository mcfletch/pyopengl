'''OpenGL extension NV.explicit_multisample

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.NV.explicit_multisample to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	In traditional multisample specs, the API only allows access to the samples
	indirectly through methods such as coverage values and downsampled
	readbacks. NV_explicit_multisample adds a set of new capabilities to allow
	more precise control over the use of multisamples. Specifically, it adds:
	
	 * A query in the API to query the location of samples within the pixel
	
	 * An explicit control for the multisample sample mask to augment the
	   control provided by SampleCoverage
	
	 * A new texture target to wrap a renderbuffer and allow a restricted class
	   of accesses to the samples
	
	 * The ability to fetch a specific sample from a multisampled texture from
	   within a shader
	
	 * A program option to enable the new behavior
