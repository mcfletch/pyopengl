'''OpenGL extension ATI.meminfo

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.ATI.meminfo to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	Traditionally, OpenGL has treated resource management as a task of hardware
	virtualization hidden from applications. While providing great portability,
	this shielding of information can prevent applications from making
	intelligent decisions on the management of resources they create. For
	instance, an application may be better served by choosing a different
	rendering method if there is not sufficient resources to efficiently
	utilize its preferred method.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
