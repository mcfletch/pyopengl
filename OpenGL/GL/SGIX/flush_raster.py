'''OpenGL extension SGIX.flush_raster

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.SGIX.flush_raster to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extensions provides a way to ensure that all raster operations 
	currently in the pipeline will be completed before the next 
	raster operation begins. We define a raster operation as an operation
	that involves the rasterization stage of the OpenGL pipeline.
	The implementation is free to decide what consitutes flushing the
	raster subsystem.
	
	The motivation is to allow accurate instrumentation by 
	including this call before stopping rasterization measurements.
	There are cases where Finish() is used, but a FlushRaster()
	would suffice, so this extension is deliberately kept independent 
	of the instruments extension.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
