'''OpenGL extension AMD.name_gen_delete

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.AMD.name_gen_delete to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension simply creates 2 new entry-points that name generic
	creation and deletion of names.  The intent is to go away from API
	functionality that provides a create/delete function for each specific 
	object.  
	
	For example: 
	    glGenTextures/glDeleteTextures/glIsTexture
	    glGenBuffers/glDeleteBuffers/IsBuffer
	    glGenFramebuffers/glDeleteFramebuffers/IsFramebuffer
	
	Instead, everything is created using one entry-point GenNamesAMD and
	everything is now deleted with another entry-point DeleteNamesAMD with
	the appropriate identifier set.  In addition, everything can now be 
	queried with IsNameAMD.
	
	This alleviates the problem we may eventually encounter where we have
	many Gen/Delete/Is functions where 3 might suffice.  All that is needed
	in the new case is to add a valid identifier to the accepted parameters
	list.
