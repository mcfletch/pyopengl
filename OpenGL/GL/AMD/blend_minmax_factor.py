'''OpenGL extension AMD.blend_minmax_factor

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.AMD.blend_minmax_factor to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	The EXT_blend_minmax extension extended the GL's blending functionality
	to allow the blending equation to be specified by the application. That
	extension introduced the MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blend equations, which caused the
	result of the blend equation to become the minimum or maximum of the source
	color and destination color, respectively.
	
	The MIN_EXT and MAX_EXT blend equations, however, do not include the source
	or destination blend factors in the arguments to the min and max functions.
	This extension provides two new blend equations that produce the minimum
	or maximum of the products of the source color and source factor, and the
	destination color and destination factor.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
