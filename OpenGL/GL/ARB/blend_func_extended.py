'''OpenGL extension ARB.blend_func_extended

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.ARB.blend_func_extended to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	Traditional OpenGL includes fixed-function blending that combines source
	colors with the existing content of a render buffer in a variety of ways.
	A number of extensions have enhanced this functionality by adding further
	sources of blending weights and methods to combine them. However, the inputs
	to the fixed-function blending units are constrained to a source color (as
	output from fragment shading), destination color (as the current content
	of the frame buffer) or constants that may be used in their place.
	
	This extension adds new blending functions whereby a fragment shader may
	output two colors, one of which is treated as the source color, and the
	other used as a blending factor for either source or destination colors.
	Furthermore, this extension increases orthogonality by allowing the
	SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE function to be used as the destination weight.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
