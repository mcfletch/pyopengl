'''OpenGL extension EXT.texture_compression_latc

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.texture_compression_latc to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension introduces four new block-based texture compression
	formats suited for unsigned and signed luminance and luminance-alpha
	textures (hence the name "latc" for Luminance-Alpha Texture
	Compression).
	
	These formats are designed to reduce the storage requirements and
	memory bandwidth required for luminance and luminance-alpha textures
	by a factor of 2-to-1 over conventional uncompressed luminance and
	luminance-alpha textures with 8-bit components (GL_LUMINANCE8 and
	GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8).
	
	The compressed signed luminance-alpha format is reasonably suited
	for storing compressed normal maps.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
