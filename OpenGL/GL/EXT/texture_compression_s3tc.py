'''OpenGL extension EXT.texture_compression_s3tc

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.texture_compression_s3tc to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides additional texture compression functionality
	specific to S3's S3TC format (called DXTC in Microsoft's DirectX API),
	subject to all the requirements and limitations described by the extension
	GL_ARB_texture_compression.
	
	This extension supports DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5 texture compression formats.
	For the DXT1 image format, this specification supports an RGB-only mode
	and a special RGBA mode with single-bit "transparent" alpha.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
