'''OpenGL extension EXT.stencil_two_side

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GL.EXT.stencil_two_side to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension provides two-sided stencil testing where the
	stencil-related state (stencil operations, reference value, compare
	mask, and write mask) may be different for front- and back-facing
	polygons.  Two-sided stencil testing may improve the performance
	of stenciled shadow volume and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
	rendering algorithms.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
