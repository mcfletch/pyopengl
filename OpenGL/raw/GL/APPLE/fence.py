'''OpenGL extension APPLE.fence

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension is provided a finer granularity of synchronizing GL command
    completion than offered by standard OpenGL, which currently offers only two
    mechanisms for synchronization: Flush and Finish. Since Flush merely assures
    the user that the commands complete in a finite (though undetermined) amount
    of time, it is, thus, of only modest utility.  Finish, on the other hand,
    stalls CPU execution until all pending GL commands have completed forcing
    completely synchronous operation, which most often not the desired result.
    This extension offers a middle ground - the ability to "finish" a subset of
    the command stream, and the ability to determine whether a given command has
    completed or not.
    
    This extension introduces the concept of a "fence" to the OpenGL command
    stream with SetFenceAPPLE.  Once the fence is inserted into the command
    stream, it can be tested for its completion with TestFenceAPPLE. Moreover,
    the application may also request a partial Finish up to a particular "fence"
    using the FinishFenceAPPLE command -- that is, all commands prior to the
    fence will be forced to complete until control is returned to the calling
    process.  These new mechanisms allow for synchronization between the host
    CPU and the GPU, which may be accessing the same resources (typically
    memory).
    
    Fences are created and deleted, as are other objects in OpenGL, specifically
    with GenFencesAPPLE and DeleteFencesAPPLE.  The former returns a list of
    unused fence names and the later deletes the provided list of fence names.
    
    In addition to being able to test or finish a fence this extension allows
    testing for other types of completion, including texture objects, vertex
    array objects, and draw pixels. This allows the client to use
    TestObjectAPPLE or FinishObjectAPPLE with FENCE_APPLE, TEXTURE,
    VERTEX_ARRAY, or DRAW_PIXELS_APPLE with the same type of results as
    TestFenceAPPLE and FinishFenceAPPLE.  Specifically, using the FENCE_APPLE
    type is equivalent to calling TestFenceAPPLE or FinishFenceAPPLE with the
    particular fence name.  Using TEXTURE as the object type tests or waits for
    completion of a specific texture, meaning when there are no pending
    rendering commands which use that texture object. Using the VERTEX_ARRAY
    type will test or wait for drawing commands using that particular vertex
    array object name.  Finally, DRAW_PIXELS_APPLE will wait or test for
    completion of all pending DrawPixels commands.  These tests and finishes
    operate with the same limitations and results as test and finish fence.
    
    One use of this extension is in conjunction with APPLE_vertex_array_range to
    determine when graphics hardware has completed accessing vertex data from a
    vertex array range.  Once a fence has been tested TRUE or finished, all
    vertex indices issued before the fence must have completed being accessed.
    This ensures that the vertex data memory corresponding to the issued vertex
    indices can be safely modified (assuming no other outstanding vertex indices
    are issued subsequent to the fence).
