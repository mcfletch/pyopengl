'''OpenGL extension APPLE.transform_hint

Overview (from the spec)
	
	The transform_hint extension provides a new target,
	TRANSFORM_HINT_APPLE, for the Hint procedure.  When the
	transform hint is set to FASTEST the GL may choose to 
	implement certain state dependent algebraic simplifications
	in the geometry transformation that affect the sub-pixel
	precision of the transformed vertex coordinates.  
	
	For example, if two polygons are rendered with identical object
	coordinates, different GL state settings, and the transform
	hint set to FASTEST, there is no gaurantee that the resulting 
	window coordinates of the two polygons will be precisely
	identical.  Therefore, precise tests of the window coordinates, 
	such as a depth test setting of EQUAL, should not be used.
	
	If the transform hint is set to NICEST or DONT_CARE, two polygons
	with identical object coordinates will always be transformed
	to identical window coordinates.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
