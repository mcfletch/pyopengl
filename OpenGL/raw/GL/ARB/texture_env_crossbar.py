'''OpenGL extension ARB.texture_env_crossbar

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension adds the capability to use the texture color from
	other texture units as sources to the COMBINE_ARB enviornment
	function. The ARB_texture_env_combine extension defined texture 
	enviornment functions which could use the color from the 
	current texture unit as a source. This extension adds
	the ability to use the color from any texture unit as a source.

The official definition of this extension is available here:
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/ARB/texture_env_crossbar.txt
