'''OpenGL extension NV.fragment_program2

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension, like the NV_fragment_program_option extension, provides
    additional fragment program functionality to extend the standard
    ARB_fragment_program language and execution environment.  ARB programs
    wishing to use this added functionality need only add:
    
        OPTION NV_fragment_program2;
    
    to the beginning of their fragment programs.
    
    New functionality provided by this extension, above and beyond that
    already provided by the NV_fragment_program_option extension, includes:
    
    
      * structured branching support, including data-dependent IF tests, loops
        supporting a fixed number of iterations, and a data-dependent loop
        exit instruction (BRK),
    
      * subroutine calls,
    
      * instructions to perform vector normalization, divide vector components
        by a scalar, and perform two-component dot products (with or without a
        scalar add),
    
      * an instruction to perform a texture lookup with an explicit LOD,
    
      * a loop index register for indirect access into the texture coordinate
        attribute array, and
    
      * a facing attribute that indicates whether the fragment is generated
        from a front- or back-facing primitive.
