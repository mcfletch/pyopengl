'''OpenGL extension NV.multisample_filter_hint

Overview (from the spec)
    
    OpenGL multisampling typically assumes that the samples of a given
    pixel are weighted uniformly and averaged to compute the pixel's
    resolved color.  This extension provides a hint that permits
    implementations to provide an alternative method of resolving the
    color of multisampled pixels.
    
    As an example of such an alternative method, NVIDIA's GeForce3 GPU
    provides a technique known as Quincunx filtering.  This technique
    is used in two-sample multisampling, but it blends the pixel's two
    samples and three additional samples from adjacent pixels.  The sample
    pattern is analogous to the 5 pattern on a die.  The quality of this
    technique is widely regarded as comparable to 4 sample multisampling.
