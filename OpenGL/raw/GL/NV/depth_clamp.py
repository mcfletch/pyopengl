'''OpenGL extension NV.depth_clamp

Overview (from the spec)
    
    Conventional OpenGL clips geometric primitives to a clip volume
    with six faces, two of which are the near and far clip planes.
    Clipping to the near and far planes of the clip volume ensures that
    interpolated depth values (after the depth range transform) must be
    in the [0,1] range.
    
    In some rendering applications such as shadow volumes, it is useful
    to allow line and polygon primitives to be rasterized without
    clipping the primitive to the near or far clip volume planes (side
    clip volume planes clip normally).  Without the near and far clip
    planes, rasterization (pixel coverage determination) in X and Y
    can proceed normally if we ignore the near and far clip planes.
    The one major issue is that fragments of a  primitive may extend
    beyond the conventional window space depth range for depth values
    (typically the range [0,1]).  Rather than discarding fragments that
    defy the window space depth range (effectively what near and far
    plane clipping accomplish), the depth values can be clamped to the
    current depth range.
    
    This extension provides exactly such functionality.  This
    functionality is useful to obviate the need for near plane capping
    of stenciled shadow volumes.  The functionality may also be useful
    for rendering geometry "beyond" the far plane if an alternative
    algorithm (rather than depth testing) for hidden surface removal is
    applied to such geometry (specifically, the painter's algorithm).
    Similar situations at the near clip plane can be avoided at the
    near clip plane where apparently solid objects can be "seen through"
    if they intersect the near clip plane.
