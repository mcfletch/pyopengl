'''OpenGL extension NV.primitive_restart

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension allows applications to easily and inexpensively
    restart a primitive in its middle.  A "primitive restart" is simply
    the same as an End command, followed by another Begin command with
    the same mode as the original.  The typical expected use of this
    feature is to draw a mesh with many triangle strips, though primitive
    restarts are legal for all primitive types, even for points (where
    they are not useful).
    
    Although the EXT_multi_draw_arrays extension did reduce the overhead
    of such drawing techniques, they still remain more expensive than one
    would like.
    
    This extension provides an extremely lightweight primitive restart,
    which is accomplished by allowing the application to choose a special
    index number that signals that a primitive restart should occur,
    rather than a vertex being provoked.  This index can be an arbitrary
    32-bit integer for maximum application convenience.
    
    In addition, for full orthogonality, a special OpenGL command is
    provided to restart primitives when in immediate mode.  This command
    is not likely to increase performance in any significant fashion, but
    providing it greatly simplifies the specification and implementation
    of display list compilation and indirect rendering.
