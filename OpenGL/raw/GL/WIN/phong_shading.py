'''OpenGL extension WIN.phong_shading

Overview (from the spec)
    
    WIN_phong_shading enables rendering Phong shaded primitives using OpenGL.
    Phong shading is a well known shading technique documented 
    in most graphics texts. 
    
    As opposed to Gouraud (or smooth) shading, which simply calculates the 
    normals at the vertices and then interpolates the colors of the pixels, 
    Phong shading involves interpolating an individual normal for every pixel,
    and then applying the shading model to each pixel based on its normal 
    component. 
    
    While Phong shading requires substantially more computation than does 
    Gouraud shading, the resulting images are more realistic, especially if the
    primitives are large.
