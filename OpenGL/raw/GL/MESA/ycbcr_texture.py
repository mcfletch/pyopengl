'''OpenGL extension MESA.ycbcr_texture

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension supports texture images stored in the YCbCr format.
    There is no support for converting YCbCr images to RGB or vice versa
    during pixel transfer.  The texture's YCbCr colors are converted to
    RGB during texture sampling, after-which, all the usual per-fragment
    operations take place.  Only 2D texture images are supported (not
    glDrawPixels, glReadPixels, etc).
    
    A YCbCr pixel (texel) is a 16-bit unsigned short with two components.
    The first component is luminance (Y).  For pixels in even-numbered
    image columns, the second component is Cb.  For pixels in odd-numbered
    image columns, the second component is Cr.  If one were to convert the
    data to RGB one would need to examine two pixels from columns N and N+1
    (where N is even) to deduce the RGB color.
