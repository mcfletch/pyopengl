'''OpenGL extension SGIX.reference_plane

Overview (from the spec)
    
    This extension allows a group of coplanar primitives to be rendered
    without depth-buffering artifacts.  This is accomplished by generating
    the depth values for all the primitives from a single ``reference plane''
    rather than from the primitives themselves.  This ensures that all the
    primitives in the group have exactly the same depth value at any given
    sample point, no matter what imprecision may exist in the original
    specifications of the primitives or in the GL's coordinate transformation
    process.
    
    The reference plane is defined by a four-component plane equation.
    When glReferencePlaneSGIX is called, equation is transformed by the
    transpose-adjoint of a matrix that is the complete object-coordinate
    to clip-coordinate transformation.  The resulting clip-coordinate
    coefficients are transformed by the current viewport when the reference
    plane is enabled.
    
    The reference plane is enabled and disabled with glEnable and glDisable.
    
    If the reference plane is enabled, a fragment (xf,yf,zf) will have a
    new z coordinate generated from (xf,yf) by giving it the same z value
    that the reference plane would have at (xf,yf).
