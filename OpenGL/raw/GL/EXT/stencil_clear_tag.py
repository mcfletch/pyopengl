'''OpenGL extension EXT.stencil_clear_tag

Overview (from the spec)
    
    Stencil-only framebuffer clears are increasingly common as 3D
    applications are now using rendering algorithms such as stenciled
    shadow volume rendering for multiple light sources in a single frame,
    recent "soft" stenciled shadow volume techniques, and stencil-based
    constructive solid geometry techniques.  In such algorithms there
    are multiple stencil buffer clears for each depth buffer clear.
    Additionally in most cases, these algorithms do not require all
    of the 8 typical stencil bitplanes for their stencil requirements.
    In such cases, there is the potential for unused stencil bitplanes
    to encode a "stencil clear tag" in such a way to reduce the number
    of actual stencil clears.  The idea is that switching to an unused
    stencil clear tag logically corresponds to when an application would
    otherwise perform a framebuffer-wide stencil clear.
    
    This extension exposes an inexpensive hardware mechanism for
    amortizing the cost of multiple stencil-only clears by using a
    client-specified number of upper bits of the stencil buffer to
    maintain a per-pixel stencil tag.
    
    The upper bits of each stencil value is treated as a tag that
    indicates the state of the upper bits of the "stencil clear tag" state
    when the stencil value was last written.  If a stencil value is read
    and its upper bits containing its tag do NOT match the current upper
    bits of the stencil clear tag state, the stencil value is substituted
    with the lower bits of the stencil clear tag (the reset value).
    Either way, the upper tag bits of the stencil value are ignored by
    subsequent stencil function and operation processing of the stencil
    value.
    
    When a stencil value is written to the stencil buffer, its upper bits
    are overridden with the upper bits of the current stencil clear tag
    state so subsequent reads, prior to any subsequent stencil clear
    tag state change, properly return the updated lower bits.
    
    In this way, the stencil clear tag functionality provides a way to
    replace multiple bandwidth-intensive stencil clears with very
    inexpensive update of the stencil clear tag state.
    
    If used as expected with the client specifying 3 bits for the stencil
    tag, every 7 of 8 stencil-only clears of the entire stencil buffer can
    be substituted for an update of the current stencil clear tag rather
    than an actual update of all the framebuffer's stencil values.  Still,
    every 8th clear must be an actual stencil clear.  The net effect is
    that the aggregate cost of stencil clears is reduced by a factor of
    1/(2^n) where n is the number of bits devoted to the stencil tag.
    
    The application specifies two new pieces of state: 1) the number of
    upper stencil bits, n,  assigned to maintain the tag bits for each
    stencil value within the stencil buffer, and 2) a stencil clear tag
    value that packs the current tag and a reset value into a single
    integer values.  The upper n bits of the stencil clear tag value
    specify the current tag while the lower s-min(n,s) bits specify
    the current reset value, where s is the number of bitplanes in the
    stencil buffer and n is the current number of stencil tag bits.
    
    If zero stencil clear tag bits are assigned to the stencil tag
    encoding, then the stencil buffer operates in the conventional
    manner.
