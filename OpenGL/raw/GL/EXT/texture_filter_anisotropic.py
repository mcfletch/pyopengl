'''OpenGL extension EXT.texture_filter_anisotropic

Overview (from the spec)
    
    Texture mapping using OpenGL's existing mipmap texture filtering
    modes assumes that the projection of the pixel filter footprint into
    texture space is a square (ie, isotropic).  In practice however, the
    footprint may be long and narrow (ie, anisotropic).  Consequently,
    mipmap filtering severely blurs images on surfaces angled obliquely
    away from the viewer.
    
    Several approaches exist for improving texture sampling by accounting
    for the anisotropic nature of the pixel filter footprint into texture
    space.  This extension provides a general mechanism for supporting
    anisotropic texturing filtering schemes without specifying a
    particular formulation of anisotropic filtering.
    
    The extension permits the OpenGL application to specify on
    a per-texture object basis the maximum degree of anisotropy to
    account for in texture filtering.
    
    Increasing a texture object's maximum degree of anisotropy may
    improve texture filtering but may also significantly reduce the
    implementation's texture filtering rate.  Implementations are free
    to clamp the specified degree of anisotropy to the implementation's
    maximum supported degree of anisotropy.
    
    A texture's maximum degree of anisotropy is specified independent
    from the texture's minification and magnification filter (as
    opposed to being supported as an entirely new filtering mode).
    Implementations are free to use the specified minification and
    magnification filter to select a particular anisotropic texture
    filtering scheme.  For example, a NEAREST filter with a maximum
    degree of anisotropy of two could be treated as a 2-tap filter that
    accounts for the direction of anisotropy.  Implementations are also
    permitted to ignore the minification or magnification filter and
    implement the highest quality of anisotropic filtering possible.
    
    Applications seeking the highest quality anisotropic filtering
    available are advised to request a LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR minification
    filter, a LINEAR magnification filter, and a large maximum degree
    of anisotropy.
