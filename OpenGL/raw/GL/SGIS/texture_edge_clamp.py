'''OpenGL extension SGIS.texture_edge_clamp

Overview (from the spec)
    
    The base OpenGL provides clamping such that the texture coordinates are
    limited to exactly the range [0,1].  When a texture coordinate is
    clamped using this algorithm, the texture sampling filter straddles the
    edge of the texture image, taking 1/2 its sample values from within the
    texture image, and the other 1/2 from the texture border.  It is
    sometimes desirable to clamp a texture without requiring a border, and
    without using the constant border color.
    
    This extension defines a new texture clamping algorithm.
    CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS clamps texture coordinates at all mipmap levels such
    that the texture filter never samples a border texel.  When used with a
    NEAREST or a LINEAR filter, the color returned when clamping is derived
    only from texels at the edge of the texture image.  When used with
    FILTER4 filters, the filter operations of CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS are defined
    but don't result in a nice clamp-to-edge color.
    
    CLAMP_TO_EDGE_SGIS is supported by 1, 2, and 3-dimensional textures
    only.
