'''OpenGL extension IBM.cull_vertex

Overview (from the spec)
	
	IBM_cull_vertex provides a subset of the vertex culling functionality
	found in EXT_cull_vertex without providing a guarantee that faces will
	be culled because of it.  EXT_cull_vertex is a technically superior
	solution, but the vertex culling aspect of IBM_cull_vertex provides
	generally useful function cheaply (without imposing the mandated
	culling found in EXT_cull_vertex).

The official definition of this extension is available here:
	http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/IBM/cull_vertex.txt
