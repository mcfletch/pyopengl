'''OpenGL extension MESA.framebuffer_swap_xy

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GLES2.MESA.framebuffer_swap_xy to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension defines a new framebuffer parameter,
	GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA, that changes the behavior of the reads and
	writes to the framebuffer attachment points. When
	GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_TRUE, render commands and pixel transfer
	operations access the backing store of each attachment point with an
	xy-swapped coordinate system. This xy-inversion is relative to the
	coordinate system set when GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_FALSE.
	
	Access through TexSubImage2D and similar calls will notice the effect of
	the swap when they are not attached to framebuffer objects because
	GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is associated with the framebuffer object and
	not the attachment points.
	
	The application should notice the display width and height are also swapped
	when GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SWAP_XY_MESA is GL_TRUE.
	
	This extension is mainly for pre-rotation and recommended to use it with
	MESA_framebuffer_flip_x and MESA_framebuffer_flip_y to have rotated
	result.
