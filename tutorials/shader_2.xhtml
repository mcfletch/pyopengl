	<h1 class="title">Aside: Compilation Errors</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">As we get more and more complex shaders, you are inevitably
going to run into situations where your shaders have compilation 
errors and need to be debugged.  The PyOpenGL convenience 
wrappers for shaders will raise a RuntimeError instance when/if 
shader compilation fails.  The second argument to the RuntimeError
will be the source-code that was being compiled when the failure 
occurred.  Normally the Python traceback of this error will be 
sufficient to help you track down the problem (with the appropriate
references, of course).</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">		try:
			compileShader( """ void main() { """, GL_VERTEX_SHADER )
		except RuntimeError, err:
			print 'Example of shader compile error', err 
		else:
			raise RuntimeError( """Didn't catch compilation error!""" )
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<h1 class="title">Varying Values</h1>
	<div class="paragraph">In our previous tutorial, we calculated the colour of each 
fragment as a constant colour (green).  Now we are going to 
make each vertex a different colour and allow the GL to 
interpolate between those colours.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">We are going to use the legacy OpenGL colour for our vertices,
that is, the colour that would normally be provided to the 
legacy (fixed-function) pipeline.  This value shows up as the 
built-in vec4 "gl_Color".  Within the vertex shader, each call 
of the vertex shader will have gl_Color assigned.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">To communicate the colour for each vertex to the fragment 
shader, we need to define a "varying" variable.  A varying 
variable is interpolated across the triangle for each fragment,
taking the perspectivally correct blended value for the vertices
which make up each corner of the triangle.  Thus if we were to 
define one vertex as being black and another as white, the
fragments generated for the area between them would fade from 
black to white (via grey).</div>
	<div class="paragraph">You will note that we define the varying value *outside* the main 
function.  The varying value can be loosely thought of as being 
declared a "global" so that it can be seen in both shaders.  
However, the varying value is is being processed by intermediate
clipping and interpolation processes.
</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">		vertex = compileShader(
			"""
			varying vec4 vertex_color;
			void main() {
				gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
				vertex_color = gl_Color;
			}""",GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">Our fragment shader, again, declares the vertex_color
		varying value.  Since we would like the final fragment 
		colour to be the interpolated colour between our vertices,
		we can simply assign vertex_color to gl_FragColor.</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">		fragment = compileShader("""
			varying vec4 vertex_color;
			void main() {
				gl_FragColor = vertex_color;
			}""",GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)
		self.shader = compileProgram(vertex,fragment)
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">Our geometry now has two components for every vertex,
		the first is the vertex position, which is the same set of 
		values as we saw in our previous tutorial.  The first three 
		floats in each vertex (row) are the position.   The last 
		three values represent the colours of each vertex.  Thus 
		the triangle (the first three vertices) will blend from 
		red to yellow to cyan.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">As noted in the previous tutorial, this "packed" format 
tends to be more efficient on modern hardware than having 
separate data-arrays for each type of data.

	<div class="paragraph">Since we want to provide both position and colour 
				arrays to the shader, we need to enable two different 
				arrays.  These two built-in arrays map to the built-in
				gl_Vertex and gl_Color "attribute" variables we are
				using in our vertex shader.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">These "enables" tell OpenGL that for each vertex we 
render, we would like to read one record from the 
enabled arrays.  If we were to do this without specifying 
the arrays, OpenGL would likely seg-fault our program
as it tried to access NULL memory locations.

	<div class="paragraph">We are using the "full" form of the array-definition
				calls here, as we want to be able to specify "strides" 
				across the data-arrays.  The arguments to the pointer
				definition calls are:</div>
	<ul class="">
	<li class="">size -- number of values in each record </li>
	<li class="">type -- constant defining the type of value for 	each item in the record </li>
	<li class="">stride -- number of bytes between the start of 	each consecutive record, in our case we have 	6 32-bit floating-point values in each record,	for a total of 4*6 == 24 bytes between records.</li>
	<li class="">pointer -- reference to the data we wish to use 	for this array </li>
</ul>
	<div class="paragraph">The vertex pointer is passed a reference to our VBO,
which tells OpenGL to read from the currently-bound VBO.
Under the covers, the VBO wrapper is simply passing a 
NULL pointer to the GL.

	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">The colour pointer also wants to read data from the 
				VBO, but it needs to begin reading each record from a 
				point which is 3 floating-point values (the width of the 
				position information) after where the position pointer 
				gets its value.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Since the definition of the array includes the step
between elements, we ask OpenGL to begin calculating the
addresses from which to read the colour information at 
the beginning of the current VBO + 12 bytes.  Under the 
covers, the VBO wrapper is simply passing a void pointer 
to the address 12 to the GL.
