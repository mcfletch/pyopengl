	<div class="paragraph">This tutorial builds on the previous tutorial by:</div>
	<ul class="">
	<li class="">defining uniform values in shaders </li>
	<li class="">passing values to uniform values from Python</li>
	<li class="">doing some basic calculations during the vertex 	shader, including defining local variables	and using some simple functions</li>
	<li class="">creating a "depth cue" via a simple "fog" function 	which alters the colour of each vertex according	the the vertex' distance from the eye.</li>
</ul>
	<div class="paragraph">Note: the shader in this example comes (loosely) from the 
	<a href="http://www.3dshaders.com/" class="">OpenGL Shading Language (Orange Book)</a>
Chapter 9.

	<div class="paragraph">Our imports are by now quite familiar...

	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">Much like the "varying" values which can be used to 
		pass values between vertex and fragment shaders, "uniform"
		values allow us to pass values into our shaders from 
		our code.  You can think of a uniform value as being used 
		to specify something which is "uniform" (the same) for an 
		entire rendering call.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">We'll define two uniforms here:</div>
	<ul class="">
	<li class="">end_fog -- distance from the camera at which the 	fog colour will completely obscure the vertex colour </li>
	<li class="">fog_color -- the colour of the fog that will be mixed 	into the (vertex) colour</li>
</ul>
	<div class="paragraph">We'll also define 2 local variables within the main function,
these variables are simple floating-point values in this case,
but could be any supported type.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">We replace our "first principles" approach to calculating the 
vertex position with the optimized built-in function ftransform()
which has certain performance and repeatability guarantees that 
the matrix multiplication doesn't necessarily provide.  As with 
the raw operation, once we have performed the ftransform(),
gl_Position is the eye-space coordinate of this particular
vertex.  </div>
	<div class="paragraph">The "z" coordinate of the vertex in eye-space represents the
"depth into the screen".  We perform a few basic math operations
on the distance value, including one which uses our end_fog
distance.  We then use the resulting floating-point value to
control a "mix" of the uniform fog_color and the current vertex'
gl_Color value.
</div>
</div>
	<div class="code-sample">		vertex = compileShader("""
			uniform float end_fog;
			uniform vec4 fog_color;
			void main() {
				float fog; // amount of fog to apply
				float fog_coord; // distance for fog calculation...
				// This function is generally faster and is guaranteed
				// to produce the same result on each run...
				// gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;
				gl_Position = ftransform();
				fog_coord = abs(gl_Position.z);
				fog_coord = clamp( fog_coord, 0.0, end_fog);
				fog = (end_fog - fog_coord)/end_fog;
				fog = clamp( fog, 0.0, 1.0);
				gl_FrontColor = mix(fog_color, gl_Color, fog);
			}""",GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
</div>
	<div class="commentary">
	<div class="paragraph">Instead of defining a custom varying value to communicate the 
		vertex colours, we have used the built-in (legacy) varying value 
		"gl_FrontColor" in the vertex shader.  The value of gl_FrontColor
		appears (with interpolation) in the similarly built-in (legacy)
		value gl_Color within our fragment shader.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Because we altered the colour of each vertex in the vertex
shader, the fog is already "baked into" the interpolated colours
we receive.  We could, instead, have done the distance calculation 
in the fragment shader, potentially using, for instance, a texture
lookup to provide more realistic "wisps" of fog, but the fragment 
shader is called far more than the vertex shader (normally), which 
means it is normally a good idea of do as much of your calculation 
as possible in the vertex shader.

		the previous tutorial.</div>

	<div class="paragraph">The purpose of our uniform values is to allow us to 
		pass values into our shaders from our (Python) code.  To do 
		that, we need to have a way to reference the uniform value 
		from Python.  GLSL provides these references via "locations",
		which can be queried from a compiled shader.  We will later 
		use these opaque references to assign values to the uniform 
		values.

	<div class="paragraph">The glUniform* family of functions allows us to pass values 
		into uniforms by providing the location in which to store the 
		value and the values to store.  There are both vector and
		individual-value forms of glUniform to allow you to use the 
		data-format in which your data is already stored whenever 
		possible.</div>
	<div class="paragraph">Here we're specifying that the fog will reach full effect within 
15 units.  OpenGLContext's default camera is 10 units from the 
origin.  We also specify that the fog will be white, so that the 
geometry will fade into the white background.  Our shaders will 
*not* be called for any fragments where there was no geometry 
present, so if we were to choose black here, our geometry would 
appear as largely-black objects on a white plain, instead of 
appearing to fade into a fog.
